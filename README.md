# IR-Sensor-For-Obstacle-Detection
A program to determine the distance between any Obstacle and the Sensor connected to the circuit (IR sensor). If the obstacle is near enough, a buzzer, which is connected to the circuit will introduce a sound to inform that there is an obstacle. If not, the buzzer will not send anything. All these indications will be shown in a LCD with the proper messages. Build the circuit and the hardware and show the results.
