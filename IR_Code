/* a program to determine the distance between any Obstacle and the Sensor
connected to the circuit (IR sensor). If the obstacle is near enough, a
buzzer, which is connected to the circuit will introduce a sound to inform
that there is an obstacle. If not, the buzzer will not send anything. 
All these indications will be shown in a LCD with the proper message. */
